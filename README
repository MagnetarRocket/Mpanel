This is release 4.0a2 of Panel.  Any problems, bugs, etc., should be submitted
to Matt Baron (mbaron@d.umn.edu) via the bug-report form provided (see the
file BugReport).  Or, you can try the automated bug report page at the
following URL:  http://www.d.umn.edu/~mbaron/panel/bugreport.html.  Please do
not send personal email.

A few other notes:

   * All documentation is available in HTML format only, and is available
     from the Panel homepage (http://www.d.umn.edu/~mbaron/panel/).

   * This is an alpha version of Panel.  Please don't expect it to work
     perfectly.

   * Please see the release notes for this version of Panel.  It can be
     accessed in the documentation section on the Panel homepage.

   * I would desperately like to get a mailing list going for Panel.  The
     problem is that I cannot run one on my school account.  If anyone would
     be willing to run one, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please contact
     me at the address below if you can help.
