-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make the program
   a. Go to the source directory
      cd src

   b. Make the make file
      xmkmf

   c. Make the program
      make

2) At this point, you should have a executable binary file in the 'src'
   directory called panel.  You can install the executable by one of two
   methods:
 
   a. Trust imake to guess where you want it to be installed
      make install

   or

   b. Copy it to where you want it to reside
      cp panel /usr/X11R6/bin

3) If you desire, you may install the panel app-defaults file in the directory
   where app-defaults reside on your system.  On my system,
   cp Panel.ad /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Panel
